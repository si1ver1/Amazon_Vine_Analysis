## Summary
According to the data above we can see there is a 10% increase in the number of five-star reviews for paid reviews. This leads us to believe that paid reviews are more likely to rate the product higher.
To further support this theory we could filter the data for reviews from verified purchases and compare the percentage of five-star to total reviews vs that of the paid reviews.
